## Business Modelling

### Product Vision

#### _FEUP Rides vision statement:_

**Empowering FEUP's community:** Facilitating mutual support, cutting emisisons and reducing congestion through our ride-sharing platform. Our mission is to make it easier to move from and to FEUP by helping you help others.

### Features and Assumptions

<ul>
<li>Possibility to request a ride either to get to FEUP or to a certain common point.</li>
<li>Being able to plan trips so people can have a better time scheduling.</li>
<li>Being able to check who is available at the moment to take a trip.</li>
<li>Being able to rate people on their service or usage of it.</li>
</ul>

### Elevator Pitch

Picture this: you're heading to FEUP, but instead of battling traffic and hunting for parking, you're effortlessly matched with a fellow colleague for a ride. That's the power of our ride-sharing platform. By connecting the FEUP community, we're not just reducing congestion and emissions; we're building meaningful connections and making campus life easier for everyone.

## Requirements

### Domain model

#### UML Class Diagram

![UML Class Diagram](/assets/uml_diagrams/class.png "Class Diagram")

The system facilitates car rides for between FEUP community members traveling to and from FEUP. 
    It involves three main entities: Passenger, Driver, and PickupPoint.

    
<strong>Passenger: </strong> Represents individuals seeking car rides. They can request rides from avaiable drivers by scheduling a request or in real-time. 
    
<strong>Driver:</strong> Represents individuals willing to provide car rides to Passengers.

<strong>Ride:</strong> Represents a ride request or offer made by a passenger and accepted by a driver.
    
<strong>PickupPoint:</strong> Represents locations around FEUP where users can gather to find or offer rides. Passengers can associate themselves with a PickupPoint to request rides in real-time.


## Architecture and Design

### Logical architecture

![UML Package Diagram](/assets/uml_diagrams/logic.png "Logical Architecture")

### Package Descriptions

- **User Interface:** Handles the presentation layer for user interaction. We will use 3 main screens: Home page, Map page and Profile page.

- **Ride Management:** Contains the core logic of our app. Ride creation, matching, map handling, user rating and other related program logic.

**External Services:** Represents external services integrated into the app.

- **Firebase services:** Cloud database, user authentication, real-time messaging and push notifications.

- **Google Maps SDK:** Provides location-related services such as geocoding, routing, and mapping.


### Physical architecture
![UML Component Diagram  ](/assets/uml_diagrams/physical.png "Physical Architecture")

### Component Descriptions

**FEUPRides App (Flutter)**:
The main component of the system, built using the Flutter framework for cross-platform mobile development. It consists of the following components:
- **User Interface**: Responsible for rendering the graphical user interface and handling user interactions and notifications.
- **Authentication**: Manages user authentication and authorization processes within the app. Is depedent on the Firebase Authentication service.
- **Ride Management**: Controls the functionalities related to ride creation, management, and interaction. Uses Google Maps SDK and is connected to Firebase Cloud Firestore database.

**Firebase Services**:
Backend services provided by Firebase that our app will use:
- **Firebase Authentication**: Handles user authentication processes like new user registering, signing-in or logging out securely.
- **Cloud Firestore**: Flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database, will be used to store all data related to user profiles, rides, ratings/reviews and also to give real-time updates.
- **Push Notifications**: Enables the app to send push notifications to users for important updates and notifications (ex. Ride found, ride cancelled, etc.).
- (*uncertain*)**In-App Messaging**: Get information about user satisfaction.

**Google Maps**:
Represents the Google Maps service integrated into the app for location-related functionalities. It includes:
- **Location Services**: Provides functionalities such as geocoding, routing, and mapping for displaying and managing ride locations within the app.

### Vertical prototype

The first version of our apk is still very incomplete but we already managed to integrate some external dependencies that we imagine are going to be essential.

![UI Snapshots](/assets/images/all_together.png "UI Snapshots") 

1. Integrated in-app notifications, ex: found a new ride in real-time;

2. Integrated Google Maps, allowing the user to browse around the map and see marked locations(ie. PickUp Points)

3. Integrated push notifications while the app in background.

2. **Scenario Testing:** Implement a more rigorous scenario testing phase to ensure that all possible use cases are covered and adequately addressed.
3. **Improve Communication:** Foster better communication within the team, perhaps by implementing regular check-ins or retrospectives throughout the sprint to ensure everyone is aligned and potential issues are identified early.

### Sprint 3 Review

#### Overview
In this sprint, we focused on completing and demonstrating our final product. The primary goal was to showcase the culmination of our work throughout the semester to our teacher and receive feedback.

#### Achievements
1. **Product Demonstration:** We presented the final product, highlighting key features and functionalities developed over the semester.
2. **Positive Feedback:** The teacher's feedback was generally positive, affirming that we achieved a significant portion of our project goals.
